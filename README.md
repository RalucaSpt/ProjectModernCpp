# Scribble Game

This project is a simple C++ game inspired by the popular Skribble game, where players have to guess words drawn by others. 

## How to Run the Game:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository to your computer.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the source file `Main.cpp` using a C++ compiler.

## How to Play:

1. In each round, one player will be designated to draw a given word.
2. The other players must guess the word by typing their answer in the console.
3. The player drawing receives points for each correct guess, and the players guessing also receive points.
4. The game continues in turns until all players have had a chance to draw at least once.
